# VisualHexo
Design a GUI for Hexo, providing an interseting page for everyone as well.

## Purpose 
- [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) is a famous blog system recently, however, normal people(without coding experience) still feel it difficulty to create a blog himself. Therefore we decide to providing a user friendly interface for these people. This project is also inspired by a another project named ["EasyHexo"](https://easyhexo.com/), which is a Document guide for Hexo Beginers.
- Cyber address is more important than the physical address in a way. The Internet is designed to let us contact with each other and know more abot other people, but these days the Internet has almost been occupied by huge companies such as Facebook, Tencent and so on, let alone the country's more and more strict regulation on the Internet. The Internet isn't equal anymore. We just want to provide everyone with a simple but awesome website page, user can add his(her) social account to the page, so that we can communicate in a more easy way.

## About
- This is also a work of 'Software Enginnering'.
